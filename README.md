#### Hi, I am Diego Esteves! 

I am a Principal Data Scientist at Farfetch and an Associate Research at SDA Research. I am currently focusing on Search and Discovery domain, i.e., Information Retrieval, NLP, and Knowledge Graphs! While working at SDA, I finished my Ph.D. thesis on Fact-Checking, exploring different algorithms under different perspectives to perform this challenging task.

Before the (more in-depth) academic experience, I worked several years in different great companies and domains, such as Finance (BBM and BTG Pactual Investment Banks), Logistics (Wilson, Sons), and e-commerce (B2W, Inc).

Besides the Ph.D., I hold an M.S. in Machine Learning (IME) and an MBA in Software Engineering (UFRJ).
